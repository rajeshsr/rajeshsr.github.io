Do agnostics even exists? Nowadays, it has become fashionable among "educated people", having discovered this term called "agnostic" to say that their religious views are "agnostic". Oh, yeah that does sound cooler! :) A lot cooler than identifying oneself with such uncool-sounding name as theists or atheists.   
  
But I have always wondered, what is going on in an agnostic's head? How does he reason about life's events? Nope, this is not a call for flame war. But a genuine question to understand an uncanny group of people and their set of beliefs and values.  
  
Well, there used to be a point of time in my life, when i believed i was an agnostic. This was a time when i was trying to establish harmony between 2 competing things affecting my perspective of life: Science and Religion! And I genuinely believed i was agnostic. I later on realized it's better to have atheism as my axiomatic belief, so that i can be more self-consistent in my reasoning and spend time actually learning new things rather than interpreting it to fit into my own religious ideas .  
  
Later on I realized, the state i was identifying myself as agnostic corresponds to a lot of intermediate transitional states, two prominent one being:  
* To start with, it was more along theistic inclinations. Belief in a benevolent God who is constantly helping me; higher purpose for my existence which God will command me to do someday(One True Will of God); and trying to reason each of the religious God as a manifestation of a single "omnipotent" God. This is something great about India. Because of India's diversity, most of our students are imparted this particular view of reconciling the "variety of God". Am not sure if i got it from school or our media/movies. And in some sense, most of the religious liberal at least use this "reconciliation" superficially. Am not sure if this belief system has a well-defined name. Should we call it the "Great Indian Religious Reconciliation"?  
  
Note that this is theism, as well. If you took theism for "Religious extremism" and being loyal to a single religion, you got it wrong! Anyway, it's all terminology, that's interpreted in various ways, so i can't blame you.  
  
* Then around the climax of transitioning to atheism, i started to believe in what's very close to:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism. Primary feature at this point is the notion that God doesn't intervene into the world. At this point, you just need a small amount of logic to realize that, A non-intervening God is no different from non-existing God: http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot (Well, i am over-simplifying here. Some deists do believe in Judgement after Death, re-birth of souls etc and in that sense they are more related to the "reconciliation view", i described above.)  
   
So, purely based on personal and anecdotal evidence with a total sample size of one(yeah, that's me), i would like to conclude that agnosticism is used to describe a state when you don't know the right vocabulary to use or don't want to be associated with theism/atheism, because you associate that only to its "extreme forms".  
  
Now, returning to the original question, what do you agnostics believe in and how you reason about your life's events? I don't think the definition, "One who believes we will never know about existence or non-existence of God" is enough to give any insights into reasoning about life's events or even any other useful "theorems of beliefs" can be formed from that definition. Feel free to enlighten me.  
  
To get you guys started, here are some examples of what i mean by reasoning about life:  
  
1. In the wake of a major failure, Individual decided to move on:  
Theist: The great Benevolent God gives suffering for a reason, in the end he will give me success twice over. Or it's a punishment for some sin i did in my life, previous life, or going to do in future blah blah..  
Atheist: It's just a possible outcome. Shit happens blah blah...  
  
2. In the wake of a major failure, individual gets depressed and may be suicides  
Theist1: This looks like a sign from God that i should reach his Holy Heaven. (And pulls the trigger...)  
Theist2: I have been a terrible sinner in my past life, that's the reason I am suffering so much. And anything i do anymore will cause more suffering. I totally deserve it, because the will of God can never be wrong (Keeps repeating it enough times and ends in a mental asylum)  
Atheist1: Ha, I got it all so messed up. I can't take it anymore. (Pulls the trigger)  
Atheist2: All my life i have been so pathetic. What are the odds of screwing everything? How can "probability" hate me so much? May be there's something inherently wrong with my genes. A gene mutation that's causing all the problems. My brain's neurons are totally wrongly wired.  This means whatever i do, i will screw it up. (Keeps repeating it enough times and ends in a mental asylum)  
  
3. In the wake a major dilemma/decision:  
Theist: I choose what God wants me to choose. (Some circular reasoning. blah blah)  
Atheist: Based on the data, I have….. Wait a minute! I have no data! Red wire or Blue wire? Screw it! I choose the red pill, ha, i mean the red wire!  
  
4. Life's purpose  
Theist: I am looking for a sign from God that says this is what I am supposed to be created… Blah blah  
Atheist: I contrive my own purpose. I just have to declare that this is what i am going to do and just gonna do it…..Blah blah  
  
5. In the wake of an alien invasion:  
Theists1: We have violated the Universal Ethics of God and the entire humanity is in a total state of moral decadence. We deserve the Apocalypse and become extinct by the Messengers of God. (Yeah, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from religious bullshit.)  
Theists2: God will send the lightening that will damage their electromagnetic devices, making it easy for us to fight.  
Atheist1: Dude, we are totally screwed!  
Atheist2: Let us decrypt their, what I think may be 20000-1024-base-digit-RSA-encrypted communication system and then understand their codes and send them a virus. It has been done in Independence Day.  
Atheists3: Did you hear what you said just now? We are screwed!  
  
Oh, yeah, atheists are a bunch of pathetic curmudgeons, just that some of them don't have that long white beards, so feel free to visualize them without that beard.  
  
But on a serious note, how do you guys who identify yourself as agnostics reason about your life's events?
