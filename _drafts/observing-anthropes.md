Here's a thought experiment:  
Assume that we have discovered an alien civilization and want to send someone to that planet to understand their system, society, beliefs, way of life, interaction, values etc. And that fortunate guy/gal happens to be you!  
What do you think you will do? How different your experience is expected to be compared to living on Earth? Take sometime, visualizing about it! :)  
  
Now, if you did really think about that exercise, it has some important feature:  
You are an outsider with respect to the alien planet. Therefore, you are outside of "participation". To be more clear, you are becoming like a God (remember, how they portray God, as someone who looks down at Earth, and keeps getting amused at human's action! :) ). That's the luxury of being outside the system. It has conferred upon you, a God-like status, just that you are deprived of the omniscience, omnipotence etc. to affect things based on your whims! :)  
To put it more clearly, you have a sense of disconnection with your environment and that gives you an enormous insights into "alien" behavior.  
  
Now, consider the following "legitimate" (however impossible :P) possibility that, such an alien planet happens to be Earth, you are just masquerading as a human, so that you could get a "first-class" understanding of humans! :) The only problem is that "participation" is thrusted upon you, by virtue of having taken a human form. But you could still choose to analyze human behavior with the same "God-like" observation, with "a healthy sense of disconnection" with the "fellow" humans! That's analyze, as if, you are outside of the "system" which your fellow humans, just take for granted! :) Yes, something absolutely no different from observing a group of apes and marvel at their interaction, behavior and the "emergence" of some notion of a "system" from such various "micro-behaviors"!  This can also be applied retrospectively; that's replay some old incidents in your life, where you are one among those apes, whom you are observing. This is one of the most awesome forms of introspection! :) And gives enormous insights. Even if, you could conclude that you have so little control as to affect any thing, it gives a lot of amusement, after all, it's participation within a system, that frustrates us in the first place! :)  
  
By participation, I mean, there's a notion of what's the final expected behavior of the group as a whole, and doing your little part to realize that. And you don't have any sense of expectation, (except as a scientific hypothesis which we are willing to let fail! ) when you observe a bunch of apes, do you?
