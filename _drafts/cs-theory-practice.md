There is an extremely interesting pattern there: http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1dfg5v/i_didnt_want_computer_science_reflections_of_a/

The people who say theory that they learn in CS is useless are those that are in college now or those who are just graduating. And those that says the theory has a huge value and it improved their thinking and they are able to see clear advantages because of their studies are, well, software professionals! :)

May be we should blame their profs? They never got a good understanding and appreciation of these stuffs, becoz they were not presented the material with right perspectives? Well, seeing that there exists a concise powerful, objective way of analyzing algorithms(O notation) and that quicksort is better than a slection sort "objectively" and it derives that power by randomness etc! Who wouldn't appreciate them, if you emphasize them enough. In fact even if there are no practical use, i may study them as if they are some interesting game! :)

A lot of concepts i have taken for granted in the past and some of them even diminished as "unwarranted praise" is because i failed to see the big picture, the way it connects with other systems and gives awesome behavior.
Anyway, with fast internet nowadays, these guys could have taken online courses to see if there is anything they are missing.

Anyway, to me CS is always about the theory. Nowadays even an 8th grader can do web development. What differentiates a CS professional from that kid? Because a CS guy will know how to identify the sub-problems, various ways to solve them and make informed (UX, latency-consious etc.) design choices that makes his users comfortable using his site. Learning a programming language or a particular way of doing things is not the best use of human intellect. It is a lot of impromptu and innovation of the task at hand that defines a great caliber! And for doing them, u shud be backed by solid understanding of fundamentals.

And technologies comes and goes. But theory remains rock solid forever. For instance, does anyone remember COBOL? These were just Javas of the 80/90s! :P But quicksort never got outdated, for instance, from 1950s! It is almost similar to giving a man a fish vs teaching him how to make his own fishing net and fish. The latter is a clear winner.
