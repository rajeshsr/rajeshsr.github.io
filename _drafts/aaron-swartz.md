Interesting read: http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/14/aaron-swartz-charges/

What people often forget is that there's this thing called Law and people of the society just follow the Law. And Law by no means have to, in fact most times doesn't reflect your idea or even the majority's idea or even the most "optimal"(objective function being human survival and excellence?) notion of ethics. That's one reason why lots of "unwritten" conventions are wide-spread in human society: Various codes of honors, implicitly understood and inferred behaviors, based on things like the awesome Golden Rule: Do unto thy neighbors as you would have them do unto you.
So, all the Courts decide is whether or not things are based on Law. All the anger against the Prosecution just doesn't make sense, once you realize that. These are just people following orders/oath/rules -- Making a honest living based on your screwed-up system!

Once in a while, as Law become obsolete, it takes some great amount of Civil-Disobedience and Activism to change it, after all, society at large, just moves along the path of least resistance and it will fail to notice any law/idea's obsolescence. Even from a general optimality viewpoint, any system will have to progress along least resistance, because that expends lesser energy, by definition. So, absolutely nothing wrong with society as well.

I see questions of ethics here: Why did the prosecution take up the case when the victim, JSTOR decided to not press charges?
As you can see, these are questions of ethics, not of Law. I don't think this is the first case where victims don't press charges, but the prosecution does. In fact, you guys will cheer the prosecutors, if the case involves a big Drug-dealer and the victim decided to not press charges ought of fear! How do you inferr if the victim is doing it ought of fear? How do you know that JSTOR wasn't fearful, in this case? Of becoming unpopular among hackers and geeks? You know what happens when an internet company is under the mercy of angry hackers! :)

In an ideal world, Aaron would not have had to display this Activism. May be his case will get us to that world -- with a new Law that emphasizes the importance of Knowledge Distribution, keeping in mind the interests of the Value Creators, in this case the Paper authors and reviewers while giving reasonable status for Content Distributors like Journal sites. I have always felt these are middle-men, who definitely deserves to be treated as site-hosters and get profit like that, rather than claim a lion's share!

This is another interesting read: http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2013/01/i-have-something-to-say-about-aaron-swartzs-suicide-and-the-special-way-the-us-justice-dept-hounds-p.html
Apparently Prosecutors are incentivized to prosecute(a no brainer ah?!), rather than uphold "justice"! :P

Although I don't understand/appreciate the final conclusion:

==

I wager the Justice Department understood Aaron's suicidal and depression vulnerabilities better than ANYONEâ€” because they make a living, a strategy, going after the weakest links, exploiting psychological deficit and isolation at EVERY TURN. Aaron had more to give the world than their whole "Just-Us"department wrapped up in a bow, but that's the least of their concerns.

But the case in point is that a lot of weak people are targeted for realtively minor crimes, just to further the career as a Lawyer!
