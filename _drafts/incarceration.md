For the past few days we keep seeing several articles on death sentences: the ethics of hanging after the convict has served a good number of years in prison, whether death penalty must be given at all etc.

I think there's a more fundamental question that is probably not explored much. May be it has been obvious to all, but not to me.

What's our fundamental view of prison and prisoners?
Do we believe prison is:

1. Correctional facility, so that we make them reasonable men of society

2. Ostracizing facility, so that they can be kept as much away from human society as possible

3. Insert any other purposes it serves.

Like every complex issue, you can summarily say that it's a combination of all these! :) For instance, the concept of parole, giving training to prisoners etc. is along the lines of "Correction". On the other hand, death penalty is obviously not; so is excruciatingly large prison sentences.

But my understanding is that there is no explicit mandate as to what should the focus of a prison sentence be. Well, in general any complex system works by a good amount of self-correction. And prison and justice system has evolved really well since, say last 500 years. But, i feel that the absence of a clear commitment, is probably stopping it from being more efficient than it could have been. Well, i believe, any goal-directed system will at least be a weeny bit better than a self-correcting system with no explicit goal.

For instance, what is the fraction of aggravated recidivism: when a low-level criminal goes to a central prison, does he come out as a better criminal, because he will meet stronger criminals in the prison and get inspired by them and come out with better associations? 

I am even more concerned about Juvenile Offenders. What fraction of them really end up being reasonable members of the society after they are done with their Juvenile Offenders Schools, which seems to have "correction" as a clear mandate, at least in India?

Yeah, there are various psychological issues here which we don't fully understand. It may be that some criminals have their brain hard-wired for crime. For instance, current theory of serial killing is associated with the subject's inability for empathy. And we are not sure if that can not be changed. But I don't believe everyone in prison or in Juvenile Correction Facility have some serious incorrigible mental trouble. And there should be a clear objective work done to really understand what's going on and come up with methods that does really "correct".
