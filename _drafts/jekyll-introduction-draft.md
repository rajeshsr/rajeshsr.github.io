There are 2 pre-dominant patterns that i am seeing there, apart from the usual, traditional gender stereotyping:  
  
1. Affirmative action: Just because somebody can benefit from affirmative action, people assume that, that's the only reason they are successful. In some sense, people also miss the point of having affirmative actions. The reason we give it is that, these people, given the same environment as you have, may have done better. They are a bit a worse now, because they didn't have the opportunity. For ex: There was some post in Quora or elsewhere where a girl was lamenting that she didn't have access to a good set of peers when some of her "geek" male-peers in college will be discussing about math/programming problems.  
  
Anyway, i was always and still is ambivalent about affirmative actions or anything that emphasizes the distinction in the system. For instance, i am against this idea of women-only event, to the exclusion of men! I mean, why are you strengthening these divide? Don't you want to make it irrelevant. Can't males crusade for whatever you are fighting for?  
  
Also, How do we know we are not taking affirmative-actions too far(Think India! ;) )? Should it always be a slippery-slope? Can something be done so that we can reap its benefit alone? Aren't we actually perpetuating this distinction, when in the long-run we don't want humans to make a distinction as males vs females or strong vs weak sections etc.?  
  
2. Beauty is dumb: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_stereotype)  
  
Well, i am not sure, if most females know about this. But, as males, we tend to judge even our fellow males based on their handsomeness. If they are too handsome, then they are not spending sufficient amount of time in grooming their expertise and are likely to not be very good, you know! So, don't take this as anything against women.  
  
There is a long history to this, at least, this is how i theorize it! :)  
  
Traditionally, looking attractive was highly de-emphasized and in fact, even looked down upon with contempt, if you are a man. You know, you are not considered a man, if you look good. You should have some scar in your face, at least! :P It was that bad, till a hundred years ago.  
Hell, for a long time i was convinced that, real geeks don't engage in physical activities or exercise or keep themselves fit! :P  
  
Combined with the idea that women are expected to look good and may have developed various techniques that can make them look good without having to spend a lot of time, so most women on the average will look better than an average man. Therefore, i think, most women will be subjected to this judgement, more than an average man.   
  
This is the bias, society has implanted in us males. So, women,don't need to feel marginalized for this. This is a terrible issue which affects males as well -- both who judge and those who are judged.  
  
Another issue that saddened me was this idea that, woman have it easy because their boss/TA/whomever superior found them to be pretty. Well, can you say the same thing, if the boss was a female and the person was a male? I guess, that's because there are more male bosses than female bosses, after all males had the head-start early, in exploiting the world! :) Or is it some inherent tendency of men to lure their opposite sex by giving them favors(however unethical) that is! Again, i don't find this hard to believe, if that's the case. Traditionally, there are all these notions of gentleman courteousness and chivalry and therefore the "gentleman" has to do something that favors/impresses the woman? May be women were never subjected to these ideas and therefore won't do it, if they were the bosses?  
  
The rest of the issues can be classified as being around traditional role of women and gender stereotyping, which hopefully will get outdated in a generation or 2, so that, if not my daughter, at least my grand-daughter will not know that these existed!
