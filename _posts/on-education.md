All usage of term "Education" in this post means "Formal Education that gets you a tangible certificate/degree". The "utopian" view of Education as "a self-edifying, enlightening process taken up by curious minds for intelectual pleasure" isn't connoted by the usage of this term, unless otherwise specified! :P

The above article, accurately portrays my notion of Education. Education can be viewed as an "Objective way to signal" that you are productive and can be entrusted to produce results.  
  
Interestingly, this view of Eduction, albeit undermines its utopian purpose, has been the attitude of common masses.   
  
Some Tamil movies of the 20th Century had the protagonist working really hard, in the midst of various turmoil in life, just to get a degree, because that's the only way through which he could signal a potential employer that he can be counted upon. And all the stories(both real and fictitious) of an underdog rising to a respectable position in society, tend to take this view of education as well.  
  
Albeit, it looks like an unwarranted generalization, I believe that the previous generation tended to take this view of Education. For them, the solel reason of studying and earning a degree is getting better pay, position etc. The whole society was founded on this premise. For instance, the Government still incentivizes the teachers who get a Masters degree compared to those who gets Bachelors. I think this is true of various other positions in the Government run firms and some clueless private companies also seem to be following this model as well!  
  
Nothing wrong with this notion. But one thing that's being missed is that, such an Education should make: good-type employees pay less for one unit of education than bad-type employees (quoted from the article.) Cost doesn't mean just physical cost. It could mean the "intellectual efforts" involved in getting a degree.  
That's higher degrees should positively correlate with higher productivity/intelligence. It means higher degrees should make it really complicated for the non-passionate "free riders" to get a degree.  
  
For instance, the Government's policy of awarding a pay rise for a teacher that has passed Masters inherently flawed. For every Tom, Dick and Harry can get one with a correspondence course on an Open University without spending much time on assimilating the subject. (I am not demeaning Correspondence course here! :) I am a big fan of self-study and very agnostic to Formal Education that awards degrees. Just that these courses are the obvious ways for free-riders to get one, second only to an Engineering degree which you can get via any of the uncountably finite Engineering Colleges in the country!)  
  
And now with so many non-quality colleges getting opened up, I think we are totally missing this important assumption quoted above to make the Education System work as a proper Signaling framework and in the long run this can make Formal Education redundant. Sometimes, I tend to believe our Education system incentivizes free-riders with emphasis on things that are not even remotely close to the real of measure of intelligence which is even more terrible!  
I think am already able to see a start of this phenomenon, with most tech companies starting to trust your Programming Competition profile, Weekend projects, pure interview performance etc.
