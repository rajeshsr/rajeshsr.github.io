Now, let's leap ahead and think about what that looks like in 100 years. Or 1000. Or whenever it is you'll think we'd have the technology to travel to another solar system. We'd be a scant remnant of what a human looks like today. Movies like to show aliens with over-sized heads and that may well be the case, but not because of biological evolution. Technological evolution will have long surpassed the snail-pass of biological evolution by then (read most any Ray Kurzweil book to hear this a lot).

Wow! I have always considered how our technological advancements like "gene selection" when creating new babies, beating death, augmenting human brain etc. will make the life different from what it is in future! But I never saw the possibility that, all these collective changes will as a whole affect the human existence.  
For instance what does it mean when we beat death: How abt living on machines with memory transferred into it and for affecting the environment, we will have actuators like robot arms or leg, instead of organic ones(assuming that we perfect human muscular flexibility in robot arms! :) ). Organic actuators are high maintenance, in relation to their usefulness. It may have made sense for Biological Evolution. But simulating it fully with all the immune system, internal signalling system like pain etc. is not very useful. With a non-organic actuators u have more flexibility like running on wheels, flying with a rocket propeller, being guarded against physical damages to the actuators as they can be replaces easily etc. So, overall, the way humans present themselves to the environment will be changed.  
So, yeah those aliens will have shown their robotic forms to the environment rather than organic forms.  
I think i agree with everything that this article is talking about. In particular, such an advanced alien beings will have lost interest in studying us to improve their state-of-the-art of their science etc. (assuming thats the only motivation for their visit)! :) Becoz they have got it all figured out.  
  
But still, the author misses one important aspect of advanced minds -- Boredom. The way boredom shapes life is always amazing. We do so many things in life just to not get bored. In fact, i will even say, all of activity in life has its simple root in not getting bored. Whether u are aware of it or not, boredom is affecting ur life a lot! An idle mind is definitely a devil's workshop, becoz it is bored and wants to substitute it with any activity. For instance the ancient sports of killing prisoners with straved Lions, with huge spectators watching is a recreation! :) And so is a lot of other ridiculous atrocities(various perversions, for instance) in life. When somebody asks, "What i should do with my life?" It is good if they can see an answer that is productive to the society! :) Otherwise untold misery can befall the mankind! Ok, that's a tautology! ;)  
  
So, yeah, these alien-guys may just go around hunting exotic species from other planets. Much like the way we are killing fishes and animals for recreation. They may also be interested in exotic alien cooking. So human meat may be an interesting delicacy they may want to add to their cuisine.  
On a positive side(for humans i mean! ;) ), they may be interested in "detailed study" of humans. That is our history, technological state of a primitive species, the vocabularies/lingusitscs we use, our concpetion and view of mathematics, our means of communications, all the major wars we fought, their causes and effects etc. Something like what our zoologists and anthroplogists are doing, but in a more advanced way.  
There are always interesting stuffs in details, no matter how good a statistical model you have. Given that u care about results only to a certain level of accuracy, you may stop after a certain initial terms. The details will be different, and they are possibly encoded in higher order terms that you ignored and at that point ur model may cease to be accurat as well. There is a lot of pleasure in understanding the details and refining models, for an iniquisitive mind.
